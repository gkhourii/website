# Geo logs 

1/31/25
Was exploring Moldavia tonight. Iasi, Romania is quite a nice city. It has a deep
Jewish heritage. Apparently the father of Yiddish Theatre made his name
there. There is a functioning synagogue, and its Jewish population actually
increased after WWII, though it's since decreased due to immigration to Israel.
The town center has an amazing cultural palace. Resembles the Hungarian parliament.
I also noticed some new infrastructure project that dug a road in a hill,
providing a lower elevation neighborhood newfound access to the city center.
There is also a university here. It seems clean. I like Iasi.

Moving to Bukovina, Chernivtsi is an even more beautiful city. It is known as "Little Vienna."
Doing some of my own research on Google street view revealed that it's
true. There are some real architectural gems. Most of the buildings seem
well preserved from before World War II, as well.
Almost every corner is studded with magnificent architectural gems.
The train station, the town squares, the Armenian church, pretty much
any building. They have cultural houses for Polish, German, and Jews.
The University of Chernivtsi left me speechless. It was designed/fudned
by a Czech philanthropist in Austro-Hungarian times. It blows away
anything here in Ann Arbor. The Law quad doesn't even hold half a candle
to that marvel of design. A love letter to life itself. That is what
architecture is meant to express.
